I wish there was a dataset like what the NYT did with how the recession reshaped the economy, but specifically for newspapers, magazines, and periodicals. I would like to see who's winning, who's losing, 
and by how much. 

I think a couple of different sources of data would be professional newspaper and journalist organizations, like NABJ, plus information from sites like Press Gazette. I think their methodology was a bit flawed, 
considering the newspapers/websites that they didn't include. Overall, I think that there is a story to be told about how Americans/The world consumes news, and how it's changing, not that its completely 
disappearing or declining. 

A dataset such as this [https://powerreporting.com/knight/] is useful, but dated. I think the general content of this data (diversity trends at 200 largest US newspapers) is a good starting point for which newspapers
should be included. For one, since this data is over 20 years old, there is a high chance that many of these papers don't exist anymore, which is also useful. Combining this list of papers with a modified 
methodology from the Press Gazette report would produce the type of useful data I would like to see on newspaper/periodical trends over the last 20 years, and provide a good look at the future of news. 

The New York Times data is also dated, as it was presented and hasn't been updated since 2014. However, I think the visualizations and method of delivery are still relevant and can be used today in a similar, useful way.
