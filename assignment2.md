Prof. Francis, I was looking at DC Stream Data and came across this Stream Condition Index (https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/02e64f3975fd4272a024fd2f11b90279/page/Data-Explorer?views=E.-coli-%28HH%29#data_s=id%3AdataSource_24-SCI_Sept2022Scores_WebAttributes_AllMetrics_WFL1_5506%3A24%2Cid%3AdataSource_1-SCI_Sept2022Scores_WebAttributes_AllMetrics_WFL1_9062%3A22%2Cwhere%3AdataSource_9-PhotoPoints_1907%3APhoto_ID%20IN%20('Battery_Kemble_Creek_1')%2Cid%3AdataSource_21-SCI_Sept2022Scores_WebAttributes_AllMetrics_WFL1_5506%3A27%2Cwhere%3AdataSource_27-61%3AStation_ID%20IN%20('RCR09'))

The story is not that only one stream is listed as having a passing E.Coli grade, although that is a very interesting piece of information. I believe the story is that the data hasn't been updated since 2019. There is no updated data on the testing of the water in the streams. All of the steams have failed a number of different measures, which are outlined on the stream explorer page. 

I think a relevant story would be why there is no recent data, and what efforts have been undertaken to improve the condition of the streams. A more recent review of the streams would be a good investigative piece as well, or comment from the District on if the data is still being tracked and where to find it. 

Additional reporting could focus on the individual metrics that were measured, such as water conductivity, nitrogen levels, phosphorus levels, and e.coli levels, and what they all mean for individual health, or for residents and families if they come in contact with the water.

I think that overall, this is a good dataset in that it provides key information on what a person is looking at, and what it means, the measurements being used, and when the information was collected. There is also contact information for follow-up, which should be used to potentially get a contact for the story. The dated nature of the information begs the question if analysis is still being done, or if it was moved to another location, department, or city government function.
