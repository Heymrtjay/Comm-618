The 25 largest US newspapers only reach .6% of the us population with their print editions, according to data from the Alliance for Audited Media. 
Not only that, even when combining numbers for all the papers distributed by a single publisher, no media group has a print circulation of more than 700,000. 
Newscorp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, has a circulation of just under 600,000. The New Tork Times is the next largest publisher, 
with a circulation of 250,000. Alden Global Capital has a circulation of 240,898 from eight newspapers; The Chicago Tribune, Daily News, Denver Post and Sunday Denver Post, 
San Diego Union-Tribune, Mercury News, Orange County Register, Hartford Courant, and the South Florida Sun Sentinel. These two companies and the 10 newspapers they manage
account for nearly half of the newspaper circulation represented by the nations top 25 newspapers. Equally interesting, or concerning is how low the percentage of the population
is covered by these news markets while newspaper circulation continues to decline.


The original article notes a number of problems with the data. For example, these numbers represent newspapers who circulate both a digital and print edition, however  if a newspaper doesnt circulate a digital edition, it was not included in the count. Additionally, the data does not provide the digital circulation numbers of any of the papers included. An anecdote is included that the New York Times boasts a digital-only readership of  11 million subscribers. This makes the data at least somewhat incomplete. 


This was not a very large dataset, but upon first glance you wouldnt see the amount of newspapers owned by the same company. For the pivot table, I organized the data by how many subscribers each company  had, as well as the percentage of the top 25 each company represented with their circulation numbers.
