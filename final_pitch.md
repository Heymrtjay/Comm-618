I want to write an article on the cost of litigation to higher education. 
AU is currently involved in a number of lawsuits. There are academic articles written by lawyers about
these costs from a legal perspectice, but no investigative work has been done on it. this will be a difficult dataset 
to gather since settlements and payouts are not readily available public information.

In addition to generally examining what data is readily available, it will also be necessary to categorize the types of 
litigation universities may be involved in. For example, Title IX cases are different than cases involving breach of contract. 

It should also be noted that universities bringing suit would also be a potential avenue to explore as well. For example, 
a number of colleges are still in court with the Trump Administration over varoius changes to rules for grants, visa statuses, 
professional designations, and a number of other issues. Even if the institutions prevail, the cost of litigation has to be 
carried by the university if and until they do. 

I think this would be an interesting dataset to try and research and gather.
