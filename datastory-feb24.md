The graphs tell a mixed story. On one hand, unemployment numbers are falling, the price of gasoline had dropped, inflation is slowing, 
and wages are increasing across most percentiles. However, I think this data fails to give context in a number of areas. 
First, in a number of graphs there is no data for October 2025, without explaination. Because the source of the data is the labor department, 
it can be assumed that the data simply was not provided, or possibly not collected. Second, there were reports previously that a senior official
was fired becasue he provided numbers that didn't present a positive picture. It is possible that this has happened again, or is still happening, 
without being reported. Third, many of these charts are presented without context of affordability in general. I think a more accurate or 
more impactful measure would involve how many people FEEL that these charts are accurate, or that the economy is working in their favor.
