This is a link to the data story that I read

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/02/09/department-of-data-lake-vs-pond/

While this is a story from the department of data, its last weeks Dept. story. I was interested in this for a few reasons
1. I have wondered for a while about the difference between lakes and ponds, streams creeks and rivers.
2. even after analyzing all of the data available, the writers came to the conclusion that the biggest difference between different
bodies of water is really who named the body, and nothing really to do with depth or water flow.
3. Region plays a bigger role in how a body of water is named than almost any other factor.
I think this is a great data set because its so large, but also because it covers the US specifically and looks at differences between states and regions.
