A great part of this survey and all surveys from Pew is that they included the research methodology. This survey was conducted from Jan 20-26
and included 8,512 respondants intended to represent America. The survey was simple in that all responses ranged between definitely unnacceptable to definitely acceptable. 
At the same time, a larger sample size and more nuanced choices for response would definitely improve the quality of the data collected. Also, 
the only differentiators used were political, and I think a survey across age would be even more insightful.
