Theres a number of different conclusions that can be drawn from this data set. One example would be that the majority of students in class have never used a version control system.

The same number of people who HAVE used version control systems (7) is the number of people who would rather take on one horse sized duck as opposed to 100 duck sized horses.

This particular set of anecdotes highlights a signifigant misunderstanding of exactly how absolutely terrifying the prospect of 100 ANYTHING with ill-intent actually is. A useful question for a future survey might be 'what is the largest number of toddlers/pets/people you have ever been in competition with at one time?' Framing the question in a different way, or adding an additional question for context might help people understand exactly what they would be up against.
