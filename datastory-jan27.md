This is the link to the data story that I found

I spoke to the class about this dataset. One of the very interesting things I saw was that across all measures, YouTube is the social media site with the most traction and usage.
The original dataset included a much more complete set of graphs and statistics, including a heat map of usage which I thought was a super useful presentation tool. One of the major
flaws with this dataset is that the data for some sites, such as Reddit and Youtube, only goes back to 2018/2019. This could indicate that prior to, the metrics werent tracked, however, 
with very few exceptions, all of the other datasets go back to 2013.
