I think this is an interesting data representation for a few reasons. First, it combines a combination of large data sets in order to focus on one overall story or question; Do vaccines cause autism? 
The use of color and variations in text and graphic size helps to draw the eye to relevant data pooints so that even if you don't read every detail, you still get the gist of the data. 
Sources of the data include the WHO, CDC, Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, British Medical Journal, and at least one research study. 
In general I think this is a good visualization, but not a great data STORY. First, it doesn't really tell a story, it just presents the data in a visual manner. 
Second, there is nothing on the methodology for finding the data, how they chose the research that would be included in the visualizations, or any significant numbers related to the individual statistics. 
For example, at the top it says 'Large studies of over 1.4million vaccinated children...", however, there are no numbers associated with any of the other, individual graphs or visualizations. 
The range of dates for the data is very wide as well, but not well recorded. There is data that is labeled from 2011 and 2012, but not all the data has such labels. 
Overall, I think for visualization purposes this works well, but as a dataset or datastory, it has some significant flaws.
